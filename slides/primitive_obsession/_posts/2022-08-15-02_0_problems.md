# What are the problems with it?

For domain concepts, while primitive types may seem like they represent the concept sufficiently, they often fall short.

* This makes non-interchangeable concepts interchangeable. One decimal is no different to any other and they can be swapped around easily.
* Where we need more than one primitive to represent a concept, we often end up just passing two variables around everywhere when really those 2 variables represent 1 concept.
