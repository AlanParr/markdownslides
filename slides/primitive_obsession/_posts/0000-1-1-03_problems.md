# Example 1: Pricing

```csharp
public void SetPrice(decimal price)
{
    // Do stuff here.
}
```

What price is this method expecting? We could solve this by just making the name more descriptive right?

```csharp
public void SetGrossPrice(decimal grossPrice)
{
    // Do something here.
}
```

This is better, until we look at how we call it.

```csharp
public void DoSomething()
{
    var grossPrice = 10m;
    var netPrice = 8m;
    
    SetGrossPrice(netPrice);
}
```
Net Price and Gross Price are both separate (albeit related) concepts within our domain, but because they are both represented by decimals, we lose any concept of type-safety. There is nothing stopping us from accidentally passing in a netPrice to a method that takes a grossPrice.
